# Cobb

**Cobb** is "yet another"â„¢ web scraper library, extracted from a real project.

It's named after Jane Cobb, infamous Serenity "public relation guy" from Firefly series.

Some ideas (though, not the code) was taken from [sinew](https://github.com/gurgeous/sinew).

## What the funny names?

You see, when we work with web scrapers domain, we'll never come with
very meaningful names, it always be like `Parser.parse`, `Evaluator.evaluate`,
or something like this.

So, I've decided to use names which are, though not domain specific,
at least fun and consistent. So, in my gem, **Cobb** use his **guns**
to **fire**, and makes lot of **victims**. And there comes **Vera**.

Deal with it. Maybe I'll change my mind in future versions.

## 1. Just Gun aka "OK, let's start with something"

The simplest usage of Cobb (also look at samples/01_simple.rb):

```ruby
class AmazonBook < Cobb::Gun
  def mechanizm
    result(
      title: html.at!('h1#title #productTitle').text,
      author: html.at!('#byline .author a.contributorNameID').text,
      price: html.at!('#MediaMatrix .swatchElement.selected .a-color-price').text_
    )
  end
end

victim = AmazonBook.fire 'http://www.amazon.com/Cats-Cradle-Novel-Kurt-Vonnegut/dp/038533348X/'

pp victim.result 
# => {"title"=>"Cat's Cradle: A Novel", "author"=>"Kurt Vonnegut", "price"=>"$8.75"}
```

What we see here?

1. how to define gun: just inherit from `Cobb::Gun` and define `mechanizm` 
  method, and everything would work
2. what you get inside `mechanizm`:
  - `html` is `Nokogiri::HTML` of the page 
    (with some `Nokogiri::More`, see below)
  - `result` is method to merge some values to result
3. how to use gun: just do `{Gun}.fire({url})`
4. what you obtain from gun: victim, obviously, and its `result` 
  - it's what you `result`ed in gun. It's a "mash", descended from
  `Hashie::Mash`, so you can `result['title']` or `result.title` now.

What you can't see, yet it's still here: requests caching. It's just 
so-called "greedy" caching: once performed, request to some URL is never
repeated again. You can control it just by removing `tmp/cache`, 
and (in future) by settings and commands. But for now it seems good enough:
you just develop some "gun" (parser), and run it as many times as you like,
and results are just got from disk.

It's pretty obivous, yet useful (on my thought), but it's just a start.

## 2. Array of results

But what if we have several data items on page? 
Oh, that's easy (also look at samples/02_array.rb):

```ruby
class AmazonAuthorBooks < Cobb::Gun
  def mechanizm
    author = html.at!('#EntityName').text
    html.css('#mainResults .result').each do |row|
      result_row do
        result(
          title: row.at!('h3.title a').text,
          link: row.at!('h3.title a').href,
          author: author
        )
      end
    end
  end
end

# or:
class AmazonAuthorBooks < Cobb::Gun
  def mechanizm
    author = html.at!('#EntityName').text
    html.css('#mainResults .result').each do |row|
      result_row(
        title: row.at!('h3.title a').text,
        link: row.at!('h3.title a').href,
        author: author
      )
    end
  end
end

victim = AmazonAuthorBooks.fire 'http://www.amazon.com/Kurt-Vonnegut/e/B000APYE16/'
pp victim.results
# => [{"title"=>"Slaughterhouse-Five",
#      "link"=>"http://www.amazon.com/Slaughterhouse-Five-Kurt-Vonnegut/dp/0440180295",
#      "author"=>"Kurt Vonnegut"},
#     {"title"=>"If This Isn't Nice, What Is?: Advice to the Young-The Graduation Speeches",
#      "link"=>"http://www.amazon.com/This-Isnt-Nice-What-Graduation/dp/1609805917",
#      "author"=>"Kurt Vonnegut"},
#     <...and so on...>
```

As simple as that. You call `result_row{some code}` or even 
`result_row(some_hash)` and you have `victim.results`. One item - 
`victim.result`, many items - `victim.results`. Not too smart, not too
dumb, obvious enough.

## 3. Next targets - interesting things goes from here!

On my experience, typical real-world site scraping is like "scrape list 
of items from this page, than follow links and scrape their description", 
and so on. With Cobb, you do it totally like this 
(also look at samples/03_next.rb): 

```ruby
module Amazon
  class AuthorBooks < Cobb::Gun
    def mechanizm
      html.css('#mainResults .result').each do |row|
        next_to Book, row.at!('h3.title a').href
      end
    end
  end

  class Book < Cobb::Gun
    def mechanizm
      result(
        title: html.at!('h1#title #productTitle').text,
        author: html.at!('#byline .author a.contributorNameID').text,
        price: html.at!('#MediaMatrix .swatchElement.selected .a-color-price').text_
      )
    end
  end
end

victim = Amazon::AuthorBooks.fire 'http://www.amazon.com/Kurt-Vonnegut/e/B000APYE16/'
pp victim.next_targets
# => [#<Cobb::Target: Amazon::Book.fire(http://www.amazon.com/Slaughterhouse-Five-Kurt-Vonnegut/dp/0440180295)>,
#     #<Cobb::Target: Amazon::Book.fire(http://www.amazon.com/This-Isnt-Nice-What-Graduation/dp/1609805917)>,
#     <...several of them...>
#     #<Cobb::Target: Amazon::Book.fire(http://www.amazon.com/Suckers-Portfolio-Collection-Previously-Unpublished/dp/1611099587)>]

victim2 = victim.next_targets.first.fire_at!
pp victim2.result
# => {"title"=>"Slaughterhouse-Five", "author"=>"Kurt Vonnegut", "price"=>"$4.83"}
```

Highlights:

1. `next_to({Gun}, {url})` - tells victim the next target and what gun
  to fire at it
2. so, the victim has method `next_targets`, which return instances of
  `Cobb::Target` class, knowing what gun, and what URL to fire, and
  having method `Target#fire_at!` to fire with specified gun
  (cynical enough, no? now you're in love with my namings?..)

Becames cooler, nah? It's just a beginning.

## 4. Context

When you fire at something, you can provide a context, and your gun has
access to it:

```ruby
module Amazon
  class Book < Cobb::Gun
    def mechanizm
      result(
        title: html.at!('h1#title #productTitle').text,
        author: html.at!('#byline .author a.contributorNameID').text,
        price: html.at!('#MediaMatrix .swatchElement.selected .a-color-price').text_,
        author_bio: context.author_bio
      )
    end
  end
end

victim = Amazon::Book.fire 'http://www.amazon.com/Cats-Cradle-Novel-Kurt-Vonnegut/dp/038533348X/', 
  author_bio: 'Sample author bio.'
pp victim.data 
# => {"title"=>"Cat's Cradle: A Novel",
#     "author"=>"Kurt Vonnegut",
#     "price"=>"$8.75",
#     "author_bio"=>"Sample author bio."}
```

It don't looks too cool, until you mix it with `next_to`:

```ruby
module Amazon
  class AuthorBooks < Cobb::Gun
    def mechanizm
      bio = html.at!('#artistCentralBio_officialFullBioContent').text
      html.css('#mainResults .result').each do |row|
        next_to Book, row.at!('h3.title a').href, 
          author_bio: bio # here goes the context!
      end
    end
  end
end

victim = Amazon::AuthorBooks.fire(url)
pp victim.next_targets.first
# => #<Cobb::Target: Amazon::Book.fire(http://www.amazon.com/Slaughterhouse-Five-Kurt-Vonnegut/dp/0440180295) 
#      with #<Cobb::Mash 
#              author_bio="Kurt Vonnegut was born in Indianapolis in 1922. He studied at the universities of Chicago and Tennessee and later began to write short stories for magazines. His first novel, Player Piano, was published in 1951 and since then he has written many novels, among them: The Sirens of Titan (1959), Mother Night (1961), Cat's Cradle (1963), God Bless You Mr Rosewater (1964), Welcome to the Monkey House; a collection of short stories (1968), Breakfast of Champions (1973), Slapstick, or Lonesome No More (1976), Jailbird (1979), Deadeye Dick (1982), Galapagos (1985), Bluebeard (1988) and Hocus Pocus (1990). During the Second World War he was held prisoner in Germany and was present at the bombing of Dresden, an experience which provided the setting for his most famous work to date, Slaughterhouse Five (1969). He has also published a volume of autobiography entitled Palm Sunday (1981) and a collection of essays and speeches, Fates Worse Than Death (1991)."

## 5. Auto-fire - don't make me think of targets!

## 6. Vera - the cutest gun ever

## 7. What else Jayne Cobb does for me, if I pay enough?

### Train with your gun

### Settings

### Nokogiri::More

Nokogiri::More is, for now, a part of Cobb, though it will be separated
into different gem in nearest future. It's some extensions and monkey-patches
to Nokogiri, which makes it easier for complex production-ready parsers.

### Some useful shortcuts
